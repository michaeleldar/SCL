# SCL (Scratch Command Line)
## Overview
### SCL is a way to control scratch from the command line. Currently we don't have many features, but in the end, 
### we hope to make it possible to be a succeful scratcher without ever seeing the scratch website.
### This doesn't mean we are trying to displace the scratch website, just making an alternative, that will
### be good for old compupters. This still relies on scratch through the scratchconnect python libary.
### Eventually we are aiming for being able to make and share projects using SCL.
